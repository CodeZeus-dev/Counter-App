# Counter App

This is a simple Sinatra Web Application that enables the user to click on either the Increment, Decrement or Reset
buttons in order to start the counting process. The App includes a timer as well so that the user knows when the counter
was last updated. The functionality of the buttons is the following:

- Increment: Increments the Number by 1
- Decrement: Decrement the Number by 1 
- Reset: Resets the Number back to 0
